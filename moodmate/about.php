      <h2>✨ What MoodMate Does</h2>
      <p>
        Every day, you experience different emotions. MoodMate lets you quickly select what you feel,
        gives you a motivational or reflective quote based on that emotion,
        and saves your mood in your personal history.
      </p>

      <h2>📘 Why Mood Tracking Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Tracking your mood helps you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recognize emotional patterns</li>
        <li>Understand what triggers feelings</li>
        <li>Reflect on your well‑being over time</li>
        <li>Build self-awareness and emotional stability</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>💬 How the Quotes Help</h2>
      <p>
        Each emotion triggers a set of carefully selected quotes that match how you're feeling — 
        whether you're happy, sad, tired, calm, angry, or feeling empty.
        These quotes aim to comfort you, validate you, or lift your mood when needed.
      </p>

      <h2>📊 Mood History</h2>
      <p>
        MoodMate stores every entry you save. 
        This allows you to revisit past moods, reflect on your emotional journey,
        and understand how your feelings change over time.
      </p>

      <h2>🌱 The Goal of MoodMate</h2>
